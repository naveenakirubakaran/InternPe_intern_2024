# Dot Game

A simple command-line dot game implemented in Java where two players take turns marking cells in a grid. The game ends when a player gets three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or when the board is full, resulting in a tie.

## How to Play

1. The game prompts the user to enter the size of the board.
2. Players take turns entering the row and column numbers to place their mark (`X` or `O`).
3. The board updates after each move.
4. The game checks for a winner after each move.
5. The game ends when there is a winner or the board is full (tie).
