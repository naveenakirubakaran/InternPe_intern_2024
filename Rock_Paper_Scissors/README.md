Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Objective:
Create a console-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game using the Java programming language. The game should allow a user to play multiple rounds against the computer, with the computer's moves being randomly generated.

Requirements:

1.User Input:
Prompt the user to enter their move (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
Allow the user to exit the game by typing "exit".

2.Computer Move:
Randomly generate the computer's move (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).

3.Game Logic:
Compare the user's move with the computer's move to determine the winner based on the standard rules:
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats Rock
Display the computer's move and the result of the round (win, lose, or tie).

4.Loop:
The game should continue in a loop, allowing the user to play multiple rounds until they decide to exit by typing "exit".

5.Validation:
Ensure the user input is valid (i.e., it must be "Rock", "Paper", "Scissors", or "exit"). If the input is invalid, prompt the user to enter a valid move.

6.Clean Exit:
Ensure the game exits cleanly when the user types "exit".
