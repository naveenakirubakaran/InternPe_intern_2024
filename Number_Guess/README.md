#Guess A Number

Develop a console-based game where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 10, and the player tries to guess it. The game provides feedback whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

🛠️ Key Features:

Random Number Generation: Utilized Java's Random class to generate a random number.
User Input Handling: Used the Scanner class for reading player inputs.
Feedback Loop: Implemented a loop to provide feedback and keep the game running until the correct guess is made.
Validation: Ensured input validation to keep guesses within the specified range.
